This is version 3.0 of axessibility, a package which allows LaTeX to create 
pdf files with mathematical formulae accessible by assistive technologies 
for visually impaired people and people with special educational needs.

The following files are enclosed.

  README                        - This file.
  axessibility.dtx                - Documented tex file of the axessibility package. Run pdfLaTeX
                                           on this file to obtain the package documentation.
  axessibility.ins                - Run LaTeX on this file to extract the axessibility.sty file  
                                           from axessibility.dtx.
  axessibility.lua                - Lua code for the automatic replacement of $ and $$ Tex markers with
                                           their LaTeX equivalents
  axessibilityExampleSingleLineT   - A sample LaTeX file which uses the axessibility package,
                                                        with inline and single line displayed formulae, employing 
                                                        the tagpdf package option.
  axessibilityExampleSingleLineA   - Same as above, employing the accsupp option.
  axessibilityExampleAlignT   - A sample LaTeX file which uses the axessibility package,
                                                    with inline and multiline displayed formulae,
                                                    employing the tagpdf option.
  axessibilityExampleAlignA   - Same as above, employing the accsupp option.

Installation notes:
The package is supplied in `.ins`&`.dtx` format. Running `latex axessibility.ins` 
will extract the package, whereas `pdflatex axessibility.dtx` will typeset the 
documentation. Move `axessibility.sty` to your local `texmf` directory.
